 * It is a real `Promise`, so `await`, `.then` and `Promise.all` all work. Awaiting it throws `E` on
 * an error status and a `CoreError` when no usable response was produced, so a complete `catch`
 * needs both. A bug rejects as the raw error it threw, outside the family. Call
 * {@link ApiPromise.asApiResult} for a non-throwing {@link ApiResult} instead.
 *
 * `.then`, `.catch` and `.finally` hand back a plain `Promise`, which has no `asApiResult` on it.
 * Call that method on the value the operation returned.
 *
 * Nothing here suppresses an unhandled rejection. An abandoned call that fails is reported by the
 * runtime: `unhandledRejection` on Node, which by default ends the process, and
 * `unhandledrejection` in a browser.

   * its first act, so a call deferred past a turn leaves the rejection unhandled until it runs.
