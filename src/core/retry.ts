/**
 * How a failed request is retried.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every field is optional, so any subset is accepted and "the defaults with two of them changed"
 * is a two-field literal. What the engine reads is this type **resolved**, with every field filled
 * in, so the policy can be read off the options rather than inferred from engine behaviour. It is
 * resolved at two layers: once when the client is built, over the engine's defaults, and again on
 * every call, over the client's resolved options, when a call passes its own `retry`, which is
 * {@link RequestRetryOptions}, three of these fields.
 *
 * A field a call leaves out keeps the client's value. A field given a value the engine cannot
 * honour falls back to what stands behind it — the default at the client, the client's value on a
 * call — and takes none of the fields beside it with it. The per-field blocks say which values
 * those are. `0`, `false` and an empty list are values, never misses.
 *
 * `timeout` is the one field that is not about retrying: it bounds every attempt, the only one
 * under `maxRetries: 0` included, so this type is what a single request may do as well as what a
 * retried one may.
 *
 * Two things are retried: a response **status**, and a **transport fault** — a connection failure
 * or a per-attempt timeout. An abort is never retried, nor is a fault the SDK itself caused, nor a
 * request whose body is a stream, because a stream cannot be replayed.
 *
 * Obtaining a credential comes before the attempt's timer starts, and a failure there is never
 * retried by the operation. The OAuth2 token request is a request of its own, timed and retried
 * under the client's policy, so a token endpoint that drops the connection or runs out its own
 * `timeout` ends the call with that request's `ConnectionError` or `TimeoutError`. A token
 * endpoint that answers with a refusal is an `AuthError` and ends the call too.
